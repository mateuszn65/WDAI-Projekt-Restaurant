# Restaurant


This is a restaurant design for the Computer Science Introduction to Web Applications course. It is a web application that allows users to search the menu of a restaurant and "order"(just a pop out info) food online. Users have accounts and can log in and out. Users can also register for an account. There exists three types of users: admin, manager and customer. Admin and manager can add, edit and delete menu items. Admin can also ban users. Customer can order food and see his previous orders (no styling...). He is also able to review the food he ordered. App is using [firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/)  for authentication and database.
